              " I am not a perfectionist, but I like to feel that things are
              done well. More important than that, I feel an endless need to
              learn, to improve, to envolve, not on it to please the coach and
              the fans, but also to feel satisfied with myself. It is my
              conviction that here are no limits to learning and that it can
              never stop, no matter what our age."
